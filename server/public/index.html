<p>Do you have ideas for role-playing games, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, who has run a few different rules systems,
and maybe one or two you've created yourself?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you flesh out you ideas, and help ensure that they has what it takes to drive weeks of 
enjoyable campaigning.</p>

<p>I call this a world builder and a campaign creator because it's about setting and situation, not rules.
You already have books full of rules. You can get free and universal systems online. And you can probably write some yourself if you have to.</p>

<p>The hard part is to come up with ideas that are <em>both</em>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creative and exciting</li>
    <li>Practical and playable</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also create an account to save your work. You can see all the campaigns created by other users. And you can
 <strong>clone</strong> them to modify or extend their ideas.</p>
