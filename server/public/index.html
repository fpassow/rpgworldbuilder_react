<p>Hello. I am currently learning front end programming with JavaScript and React. </p>

<h2>Web Applications</h2>

<h3><a href="rpgwbindex.html"> RPG World Builder</a></h3>
<p>This is a tool to help design fun, playable campaign ideas for tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
<p>It's central feature is a form which is created dynamically from a JSON file (<a href="def.json">src/def.json</a>). Users can create accounts, create campaigns, see everyone's campaigns, and clone their own copies of other campaigns.</p>

<p>It is a Node+Express application using React for rendering and MongoDB for its database.</p>

<p>It actually started out in PHP because PHP was used at work. I changed it to a single page web app using
	jQuery because the reloads felt clunky. At first, it was a set of separate components for Login, the
	Campaigns List, and the Campaign display+editing area for a single campaign. All the components 
	supported callbacks to announce intersting state changes and they all tried to update how they displayed
	themselves to match the new state of another component. This hurt. I thought it would be a lot simpler
	if there was just one central Big Ball of State, and all the parts were just told to redraw themselves
	when it changed. This iteration fed events into a controller which modified the Big Ball of State and
	talked to the REST services. Once the new state was known, the controller called &quot;view functions&quot; to Redraw Everything. And it was all simple enough that performance was suprisingly OK. But now I've redone it with React. But I think I learned a lot by recreating historical stages
	that lead up to React.
</p>
<p>It's on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fpassow/rpgworldbuilder_react">here</a>. And previous incarnations have their own repos.</p>
