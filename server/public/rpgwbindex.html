<p>Do you have ideas for role-playing game worlds and campaigns, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, who has run a few different rules systems?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you develop an idea you love into a successful campaign.</p>

<p>This isn't about rules. You already have books full of rules. You can get free, universal systems online.</p>

<p>The hard part is to get <em>both</em>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>New, creative, and awesome</li>
    <li>Practical and playable</li>
</ol>

<p>This tool starts with your <i>new, creative, and awesome</i> and helps with the <i>practical and playable</i> part. That way, you can go wild with whatever idea you would love to run, with confidence that you will be able to write and run weeks of enjoyable adventures for your friends.</p>

<p>You can use the tool to sketch out as many ideas as you want, and create an account to save your work. You can also see all the campaigns created by other users. And you can
 <strong>clone</strong> them to modify or extend their ideas.</p>

<p>And note that anyone else can see, use, and be inspired by your ideas, too.</p> 

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>If you want, you can just jump in and <a href="rpgworldbuilder.html">try it</a>. Or, read on...</p>

<p>First, I want to be 100% clear that this is a safety net, not a straitjacket. Feel free to ignore any part that does&apos;t fit your own idea.</p>

<p>That said, the tool asks questions designed to ensure that the campaign world...</p>

<ol>
	<li>Has life and activity beyond the PCs.</li>
	<li>Includes fun details that apply to actual gameplay.</li>
	<li>Has reliable sources of adventure &quot;hooks&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've called the sources of adventure hooks &quot;drivers&quot;. They are patterns that have worked in
 other games. And their goal is to ensure that you can always sit down and write a fun adventure, even
 without any specific new inspiration. (We&apos;ve all been there.)
</p>

<p>After you've filled out the form, I suggest saving it and coming back to it later. Then look at each answer, and ask yourself, &quot;is this just kind of normal and average?&quot; And if it is, change it.  :-)</p>

<p>Once you&apos;really happy with a campaign idea in this system, click &quot;printable view&quot; to open a simple text version of your work in another tab, and print it and/or save it. You&apos;re done with this system and ready to carry on developing the campaign by your usual methods with a notebook, word processor, index cards, or whatever you prefer.</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
