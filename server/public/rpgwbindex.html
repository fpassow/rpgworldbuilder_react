<p>Do you have ideas for role-playing game worlds and campaigns, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, who has run a few different rules systems?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you develop an idea you love into a successful campaign.</p>

<p>This isn't about rules. You already have books full of rules. You can get free, universal systems online.</p>

<p>The hard part is to get <em>both</em>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>New, creative, and awesome</li>
    <li>Practical and playable</li>
</ol>

<p>This tool starts with your <i>new, creative, and awesome</i> and helps with the &quot;practical and playable&quot; part. That way, you can go wild with whatever idea you would love to run, with confidence that you will be able to write and run weeks of enjoyable adventures for your friends.</p>

<p>You can use the tool to sketch out as many ideas as you want, and create an account to save your work. You can also see all the campaigns created by other users. And you can
 <strong>clone</strong> them to modify or extend their ideas.</p>

<p>And note that anyone else can see, use, and be inspired by your ideas, too.</p> 

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>If you want, you can just jump in and <a href="rpgworldbuilder.html">try it</a>. Or, read on...</p>
