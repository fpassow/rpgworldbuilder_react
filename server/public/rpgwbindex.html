<p>Do you have ideas for role-playing game worlds and campaigns, but wonder if you can turn
them into something you can really play with your friends?</p>

<p>Are you an experienced GM, who has run a few different rules systems,
and maybe one or two you've created yourself?</p>

<p>If you answered yes to both questions above, this site is for you. The tool on the next page
will help you flesh out you idea, and help ensure that it has what it takes to drive weeks of 
enjoyable campaigning.</p>

<p>I call this a world builder and a campaign creator because it's about setting and situation, not rules.
You already have books full of rules. You can get free and universal systems online. And you can probably write some yourself if you have to.</p>

<p>The hard part is to come up with ideas that are <em>both</em>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>New and interesting</li>
    <li>Practical and playable</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the tool to sketch out as many ideas as you want. And create an account to save your work. You can also see all the campaigns created by other users. And you can
 <strong>clone</strong> them to modify or extend their ideas.</p>

<p>And note that anyone else can see, use, and be inspired by your ideas, too.</p>
