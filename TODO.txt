 An epic is
"epic" because it deals explicitly with the largest and most important
questions of humankind: what is the meaning of life? why are we
here? who is God and what is She doing? what is the religious and/or
moral order of the universe? In fact, back in the days when epics
were more commonly written, their acknowledged purpose was to
tackle such questions.
